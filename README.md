## About Event Booking App

The application allows customers to book tickets for events, providing details such as event name, start and end date and time, city, country, ticket allocation, and maximum tickets per customer. Customers can filter events by country and start date, then select an event and enter their first name, last name, email address, and desired number of tickets. Upon booking, a confirmation screen is displayed.

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Current Features
As of now, the application provides the following functionalities:

### 1: Listing Events: 
Customers can visit the application via http://127.0.0.1:8000/events to see a list of all available events.

### 2: Filtering Events:

#### * 1: By Country: 
Customers can filter events based on the country in which the events are being held.
#### * 2: By Date:
##### * Date Range: 
Customers can select a range of dates to see all events whose start date falls within that range.
##### *Single Date: 
Customers can select a single date to see all events that occur on or after the selected date.

Customers can use either of the filters or both simultaneously to narrow down their search for events.
